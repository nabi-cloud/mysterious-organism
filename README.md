## Project Overview

A mysterious organism named Pila aequor *(P. aequor)* is found near hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean. The project is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor. These simulated DNA samples will enable the study of the organism's genetic makeup, behavior, and mutation patterns.

## Project Requirements

- **Survivability Criteria:** Determine if P. aequor will likely survive if DNA is composed of at least 60% 'C' or 'G' bases.
- **DNA Comparison:** Compare the DNA of different P. aequor instances and compute how many bases are identical in the same locations.
- **DNA Mutation:** A randomly selected base must be changed to any of the DNA bases it cannot revert back to the original base.

## Reflections

Working with objects is really challenging! When passing parameters within objects, it became complex to ensure that the right information was passed on accurately. For example, when simulating DNA mutations, passing the correct base information while avoiding hard-coded values. This meant thinking critically on naming objects and methods to handle variability while maintaining consistency and accuracy in the factory function.
